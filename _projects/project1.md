I am currently looking for new research projects as I pursue an MPH at Johns Hopkins University. My primary research interest is Cancer Prevention. My primary goal is to utilize my Python and R programming skills to obtain insights relevant to Cancer Prevention from Genomic, Proteomic and Epidemiologic data.
