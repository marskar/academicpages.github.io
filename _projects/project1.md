I am currently working with Professor Elizabeth Platz as I pursue an MPH at Johns Hopkins University. My project entails utilizing my Bash, Python and R programming skills to obtain insights relevant to lung cancer risk from Genomic and Epidemiologic data in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) dataset. This project is well aligned with my research interests: Cancer Prevention, Genomics and Epidemiology. You can find more information about this project in [this presentation](https://marskar.github.io/jupyter-notebook-slides).
