[NxtWrd](https://marskar.shinyapps.io/DScapFinal) is a web application that can predict the next word based on text input from the user. I created it using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org) and the [Shiny R package](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
The [NxtWrd app](https://marskar.shinyapps.io/DScapFinal/) is available through shiny.apps.io. The [code and an R presentation describing the NxtWrd app](https://github.com/marskar/DScapFinal) is available on GitHub.
