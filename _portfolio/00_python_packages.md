I wrote four Python packages that are available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

- [`nbless`](https://pypi.org/project/nbless/) - create and execute [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) from [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and scripts.

- [`catren`](https://pypi.org/project/catren/) - create and render [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files from [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and scripts.

- [`skippy`](https://pypi.org/project/skippy/) - simplify analysis of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning [datasets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/).

- [`scattr`](https://pypi.org/project/scattr/) - add user-defined functions as [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects) to Python [classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).
