Open source Python packages that I wrote and maintain:

- [`nbless`](https://pypi.org/project/nbless/) - A package for programmatic [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html) workflows. For example, you can create Jupyter notebooks from [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and Python or R scripts. [Documentation](https://py4ds.github.io/nbless/). [GitHub repository](https://github.com/py4ds/nbless/).

- [`rmdawn`](https://pypi.org/project/rmdawn/) - Construct [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files from [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and scripts or the reverse: extract Python or R code and markdown from an R markdown file. [Documentation](https://py4ds.github.io/rmdawn/). [GitHub repository](https://github.com/py4ds/rmdawn/).

- [`gitone`](https://pypi.org/project/gitone/) - Accomplish multiple [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control steps with **one** command. [Documentation](https://py4ds.github.io/gitone/). [GitHub repository](https://github.com/py4ds/gitone/).

Packages I wrote but no longer maintain:

- [`skippy`](https://pypi.org/project/skippy/) - Simplify analysis of [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning [datasets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/).

- [`scattr`](https://pypi.org/project/scattr/) - Add user-defined functions as [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects) to Python [classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).
