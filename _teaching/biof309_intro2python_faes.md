The Introduction to Python (BIOF309) course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program. Week by week we slowly build up skills and understanding of programming and the Python language. There will be in class demonstrations, using Jupyter Notebooks, activities to be completed outside of class, mostly using DataCamp, and homework for you to practice and learn at your own pace.
