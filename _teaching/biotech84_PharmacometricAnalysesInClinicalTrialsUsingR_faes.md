In this course, participants learn basic pharmacology theory with introductory statistics using a popular open source software program (R Studio) that is capable of conducting pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure and pharmacodynamic (PD) response analyses from example clinical trial data. Ultimately, the framework of analyzing exposure/response relationships will be demonstrated in order to make decisions to guide drug development.
