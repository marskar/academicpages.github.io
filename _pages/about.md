My name is Martin. I am a National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Prevention Fellow currently pursuing an Master of Public Health (MPH) degree at Johns Hopkins University.

Before becoming a Cancer Prevention Fellow, I worked on immunotherapeutics as a postdoctoral fellow in the Oncogenomics Section of the NCI Genetics Branch and the Lymphoid Malignancies Section of the NHLBI Hematology Branch.

After conducting laboratory research for roughly a decade, I want to now focus on computational work and improving my statistical computing skills. I use the Python and R programming languages in addition to command line (bash) tools to analyze and visualize data. I am interested in applying Genomics and Immunology experience to the study and immunoprevention of cancer.

A fun fact about me is that I speak 4 languages (English, Polish, Russian and Spanish) and I am learning French. I studied Mandarin Chinese in the past.
